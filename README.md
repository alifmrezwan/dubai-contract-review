Welcome to the Dubai Contract Review Roadmap. Over the next six months, I will transform my University of London LLB foundation and existing drafting experience into a thriving remote contract-review practice for Dubaiâ€“based law firms. This journey is structured to build contract-law fundamentals, deepen clause-level expertise, master UAE-specific commercial frameworks, and develop hands-on samples using tools like DocuSign, Trello, and Slack. By Month 3, I aim to secure a $1K-per-month retainer, and by Month 6 to scale to $5K / month through niche specialization, repeat clients, and thought leadership. This repository contains course notes, sample agreements, templates, and weekly deliverables to chart my progress.
